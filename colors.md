# Artisan E-Commerce Platform Color Scheme

This document outlines the recommended color scheme for an artisan e-commerce platform, designed to evoke authenticity, craftsmanship, and a modern user experience.

## Primary Color Palette

1. **Warm Beige (#F5E8C7)**  
   - **Purpose**: Creates a natural, handmade feel, reminiscent of raw materials like clay or wood. Neutral and cozy.  
   - **Usage**: Backgrounds, large sections, or subtle textures.

2. **Deep Terracotta (#A63F38)**  
   - **Purpose**: Adds a rich, earthy pop of color that feels artisanal and conveys passion and creativity.  
   - **Usage**: Accents, buttons, headers, or call-to-action elements.

3. **Soft Olive Green (#8A9A5B)**  
   - **Purpose**: Suggests nature and sustainability, aligning with artisan values. Harmonizes with beige and terracotta.  
   - **Usage**: Secondary accents, icons, or hover effects.

4. **Creamy White (#FFF8F0)**  
   - **Purpose**: Clean and timeless, keeps focus on products while maintaining a soft, approachable aesthetic.  
   - **Usage**: Text backgrounds, product cards, or negative space.

## Complementary Colors

- **Muted Gold (#D4A017)**: Subtle highlights for borders, icons, or trust badges to suggest quality craftsmanship.  
- **Slate Gray (#4A5A6B)**: Text or minor details for contrast while keeping the palette grounded.

## Why This Palette Works

- **Artisan Appeal**: Earthy tones (beige, terracotta, olive) reflect natural materials and handmade goods.  
- **Modern and Clean**: Creamy white and neutrals ensure a fresh, professional look.  
- **Psychology**: Warm colors evoke trust and creativity; greens promote calmness to encourage browsing.  
- **Accessibility**: High contrast (e.g., white text on terracotta) meets WCAG 4.5:1 ratio for readability.

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Product Pages**: Use beige or creamy white backgrounds to highlight products (e.g., ceramics, textiles). Terracotta for "Add to Cart" buttons.  
- **Navigation**: Olive green or slate gray for menus to ensure intuitive flow.  
- **Branding**: Muted gold in logos or trust badges to elevate perceived quality.  
- **Accessibility**: Test contrast for text on colored backgrounds to ensure readability.

## CSS/Tailwind Integration

Define the palette in a CSS file or Tailwind configuration for consistency:

```javascript
theme: {
  colors: {
    'artisan-beige': '#F5E8C7',
    'artisan-terracotta': '#A63F38',
    'artisan-olive': '#8A9A5B',
    'artisan-cream': '#FFF8F0',
    'artisan-gold': '#D4A017',
    'artisan-slate': '#4A5A6B',
  }
}
```

## Notes

- Adjust the palette for specific vibes (e.g., vibrant, minimalist, luxurious) based on brand needs.
